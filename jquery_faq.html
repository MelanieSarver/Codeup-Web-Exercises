        <h3>Niagara</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Niagara Falls is the collective name for three waterfalls that straddle the international border
                    between Canada and the United States; more specifically, between the province of Ontario and the state of New
                    York.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They form the southern end of the Niagara Gorge.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is not a National Park, so our cohort was named after a lesser State Park. :(  Feeling under appreciated?
                </li>
                <li>
                    The little boats that take tourists to the base of the falls are called "The Maid of the Mist."
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Glacier</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As the Crown of the Continent, Glacier is the headwaters for streams that flow to the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf
                    of Mexico, and to Hudson's Bay. What happens here effects waters in a huge section of North America.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Straddling the US Canadian border, the official name is Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Jellystone</h3>
           <ul>
               <li>
                    Fun camping for the whole family
               </li>
               <li>
                    Best known for it's friendly wildlife, be sure to guard your pic-a-nik baskets or you might lose one to a
                    bear!
               </li>
               <li>
                   When you google Jellystone, you will also get results for Yellowstone, because apparently many people confuse
                   this cartoon reference with the actual National Park.
               </li>
               <li>
                   If you are still confused, this park is from a cartoon, but it has spawned theme campgrounds around the country.
               </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>YellowStone</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Yellowstone was the first National Park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in
                    the world.
                 </li>
                <li>
                    The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially Old Faithful Geyser,
                    one of its most popular features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don't try to bathe in the geothermals. You will die. Don't be dumb.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also, please don't "rescue" wildlife from the cold by putting them in your vehicle. They live outside.
                    Don't be dumb.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Grand Canyon</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Unique combinations of geologic color and erosional forms decorate a canyon that is 277 river miles (446km)
                    long, up to 18 miles (29km) wide, and a mile (1.6km) deep. Grand Canyon overwhelms our senses through its
                    immense size
                </li>
                <li>
            For a special trip, make sure to book tickets on the Grand Canyon Train
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Everglades</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Everglades National Park protects an unparalleled landscape that provides important habitat for numerous rare
                    and endangered species like the manatee,  American crocodile, and the elusive Florida panther.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Seriously, folks, stop dumping your exotic snakes into the Everglades.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Big Bend</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There is a place in Far West Texas where night skies are dark as coal and rivers carve temple-like canyons in
                    ancient limestone. Here, at the end of the road, hundreds of bird species take refuge in a solitary mountain
                    range surrounded by weather-beaten desert. Tenacious cactus bloom in sublime southwestern sun, and diversity
                    of species is the best in the country.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Crater Lake</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Crater Lake inspires awe. Native Americans witnessed it form 7,700 years ago, when a violent eruption triggered
                    the collapse of a towering volcano. Scientists marvel at its purity: fed by rain and snow, itâ€™s the deepest lake
                    in the USA and perhaps the most pristine on earth.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Mammoth Cave</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Mammoth Cave National Park preserves the cave system and a part of the Green River valley and hilly country
                    of south central Kentucky. This is the world's longest known cave system, with more than 400 miles explored.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Gettysburg</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Battle of Gettysburg was a turning point in the Civil War, the Union victory that ended General Robert E.
                    Lee's second and most ambitious invasion of the North. Often referred to as the "High Water Mark of the Rebellion",
                    Gettysburg was the Civil War's bloodiest battle and was also the inspiration for President Abraham Lincoln's
                    immortal "Gettysburg Address".
